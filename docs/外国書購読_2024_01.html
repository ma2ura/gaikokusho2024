<h1>Fundamentals of Auditing Financial Reports Auditing</h1>
<section id="auditing" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="auditing">Auditing</h2>
<p>An audit is an independent examination of the records of an organization to ascertain how far the financial statements as well as non financial disclosures, present a true and fair view of the concern. It also provides assurance that the systems of record-keeping are well-controlled and accurate as required by law. Auditing has become such a ubiquitous phenomenon in the corporate and the public sector that academics started identifying an “Audit Society” (Power 1997).</p>
<p>The earliest surviving mention of a public official charged with auditing government expenditure is a reference to the Auditor of the Exchequer in England in 1314 (Matthews 2006). The Auditors of the Imprest were established under Queen Elizabeth I in 1559 with formal responsibility for auditing Exchequer payments. Modern concepts of “auditing” grew out of practices from the sixteenth century English manorial accounting. The medieval Latin term was “auditus compoti” from Latin auditus “a hearing,” at a time that literacy levels were low, and an official examination of accounts was presented orally.</p>
<p>Auditing initially existed primarily for governmental accounting and was concerned mostly with record-keeping rather than accounting procedures (Matthews 2006). It was not until the Industrial Revolution in the eighteenth century that auditing began evolving into a field of fraud detection and financial accountability.</p>
<p>The early twentieth century saw the standardization of ‘auditors’ testing methods and reporting practices and a growing role by banks and shareholders for public companies. Auditors developed a system for examining a representative sample of a company’s transactions, rather than examining each transaction in detail, allowing audits to be completed in less time and at lower costs. By that time, audit findings were regularly presented as standard “Independent Auditor’s Reports” accompanying a firm’s financial statements.</p>
<p>Statistical sampling of transactions is now the industry standard in performing audits. As a consequence, computer tools to conduct statistical samples and opinions based on them are an integral part of modern auditing. It is only when gross errors or fraudulent activities are uncovered that comprehensive audits are performed. As businesses have increased in complexity, such “risk-based” auditing has evolved to make auditing more efficient and economical. Risk-based auditing starts by assessing whether an audit is even needed, based on a review of information in the financial statements. If the review .nds adverse trends or irregularities, audit scope may be expanded accordingly. Through audits, stakeholders may effectively evaluate and improve the effectiveness of risk management, control, and corporate governance.</p>
<p>In the USA, audits of publicly traded companies are governed by rules laid down by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), which was established by Section 404 of the Sarbanes.Oxley Act of 2002. Such an audit is called an integrated audit, where auditors, in addition to an opinion on the financial statements, must also express an opinion on the effectiveness of a company’s internal control over financial reporting, in accordance with PCAOB Auditing Standard No.&nbsp;5.</p>

<section id="computers-in-auditing-and-the-birth-of-audit-analytics" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="computers-in-auditing-and-the-birth-of-audit-analytics">Computers in Auditing and the Birth of Audit Analytics</h2>
<p>When I received my undergraduate degree in statistics in 1971, the job market offered very little employment in statistics. Mainframe computers had just been introduced, and data resided on 80-column Hollerith cards. All data analyses were done on paper ledgers with adding machines. Microcomputers, cloud computing, and remote storage were yet to be invented. What a difference 50 years has made. For a growing number of people, data analysis is a central part of their job today.</p>
<p>Increased data availability, more powerful computing, and an emphasis on analytics-driven decision in business has created a plethora of jobs in data science. There are around 2.5 million openings (and increasing) for data analytics jobs in the USA at any time.</p>
<p>A significant share of employees analyze data with Microsoft Excel or other spreadsheet programs like Google Sheets. Others use proprietary statistical software like SAS, Stata, or SPSS that they often first learned in school. While Excel and SAS are widely used tools, they have serious limitations. Excel con.ates metadata (headings and descriptions) with formulas and data; and all are called “cells” in Excel. Furthermore Excel is horrendously slow, cannot handle datasets above a certain size, and does not easily allow for reproducing previously conducted analyses on new datasets. The main weaknesses of programs like SAS are that they were developed for very specific uses in the mainframe era of the 1970s and 1980s and have missed out on many of the newest developments in analytics. Nor do they have a large community of contributors constantly adding new tools.</p>
<p>For those who have reached the limits of Excel, SAS, and their ilk, there is a next step: learn R or Python. R and Python are the two most popular programming languages used by data analysts and data scientists. Both are free and open source and were developed in the early 1990s—R (an open-source version of the “S” language) for statistical analysis and Python (after Monty Python) as a general-purpose programming language. For anyone interested in machine learning, working with large datasets, or creating complex data visualizations, both have become standard tools for analysis.</p>
<p>Corporate computing offers more data analytics jobs requiring Python. In contrast, in academe, consulting, and finance, R offers an expanded set of data cleaning and analysis tools that are useful in one-off data analysis. Learning either requires a significant time investment—particularly if you have never coded before. Python is better for data manipulation and repeated tasks, while R is good for ad hoc analysis and exploring datasets.</p>
<p>Python tends to be in demand in companies run by computer scientists and with a code base, partly because it is easy to learn once you know other languages. Python is most useful for relatively routine, predictable processes. From pulling data, to running automated analyses over and over, to producing visualizations like maps and charts from the results, Python is the better choice.</p>
<p>R tends to be in demand in consulting fields where every report is ad hoc. Neither is a particularly efficient language from a purely operational standpoint; for that you would turn to C++. Over the past 5 years there has been substantial competition in offerings of interactive development environments (IDEs) to promote the use of either language. The R IDE is called R-Studio and is managed by J. J. Allaire (originally from South Bend, IN, and who developed the ColdFusion web development software many years ago). Python is supported on NetBeans and Eclipse IDEs through plugins; but the go to Python environment is Anaconda, which has its own version of Python, and supports R as well as other programs.</p>
<p>R is good for statistics-heavy projects and one-time analyses of a dataset. R is also more dif.cult to learn, as many of its conventions assume you have a solid background in statistics. Python conceptually uses the same control structures and data types that you will .nd in other languages, which is why computer scientists prefer Python. They see R as being more of a statistical tool that also happens to have a language, rather than a well-designed language before anything else (as Python arguably is). R has Reticulate that allows any program written in Python to be used in R; it also has Rcpp (written and maintained by Chicago’s Dirk Eddelbuettel) that allows C++ programs to be used in R. Although powerful, R as a programming language may seem very unfamiliar and quirky to developers in more general-purpose languages.</p>
<p>No matter how brilliant your analyses are, if you cannot communicate them, they are worthless. Report writing, publication on webs, GitHub, and other outlets are all essential parts of being a data analyst. In support of this, R has the report writing tool called knitr (the author himself spells it with a lower case letter k). Python has its counterpart, Jupyter notebooks (which can be used with R now), and although they are conceptually similar, their intended purpose is quite different. Though not particularly well suited for exploratory analysis, knitr is a powerful tool for dynamic data report generation so much so that it is a worthy addition to any programmer’s toolbox.</p>
<p>For example, assume you have a CSV file with some entries that you want to present to someone (or yourself) in some graphical way on regular basis. You can open it in Excel, add a pivot table and graphs; but assume then that you need to combine this data with one or more XML files and some more data in a database—this becomes a scripting task. Excel can still help, but it would be laborious. Python can also accomplish this, but you will need to learn quite a few libraries before you are ready. But knitr and R Markdown can easily generate PDF reports with all the graphical and data-processing tools of R included. Additionally, R segues statistics with machine learning, which is important since the concepts of machine learning and artificial intelligence derive from statistics. Much of the Python-based literature on machine learning completely misses underlying statistical concepts and consequently fails to be as effective as R in developing machine learning algorithms. It is written by computer scientists who understand well the Python scienti.c stack, and who will demonstrate the steps in rote manner of how to achieve a certain goal, but would not be able to impart much insight into what happens behind the scenes.</p>
<p>Much of the popular press “artificial intelligence” news you may read is a product of hackers who may understand “how” to program something, but along the way seem to have missed the “why?” and “what?” In contrast, books by authors who actually teach statistical curricula on which the machine learning practice is based and which skillfully elucidate deep theoretical foundations, all seem to exclusively presume basic to intermediate knowledge of R. If you are planning to work in machine learning, R is a much more worthwhile investment than Python.</p>
<p>The preceding are some of my admittedly biased opinions. I think R is the better language; but with the caveat that “your mileage may vary” and you should choose your own path. I firmly believe, though, that the extra effort in learning R will be rewarded tenfold if you intend to work in data analytics.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-roots-of-modern-financial-accounting-and-auditing">The Roots of Modern Financial Accounting and Auditing</h2>
<p>Accounting and auditing are ancient, with many modern practices that are rooted in traditions that date back millennia. This section details the evolution of accounting, with explanations of how historical developments live on in idiosyncrasies of accounting and auditing today.</p>
<p>The earliest extant record of humans keeping track of numbers are the Lebombo Bones (several dozen have been found to date), which have been carbon dated to about 35,000 BCE. These are arguably the oldest known accounting computers. They are tally sticks with counting notches carved into a baboon’s .bula, found in the Lebombo mountains located between South Africa and Swaziland.</p>
<p>In the middle of the ninth millennium BCE, communities began coalescing around marketplaces that eventually became the cities of antiquity. Accounting was practiced in the ancient Middle East by means of small counters—tokens modeled in clay in different shapes, each symbolizing a particular commodity. Their shapes include spheres, .at and lenticular disks, cones, tetrahedrons, and cylinders. These forms seem fully arbitrary and were decided based on the requirement of least production effort. They were easy to identify and replicate and embodied daily life commodities.</p>
<p>With stylized signs, all information could be recorded directly on clay tablets, which were cheaper and more portable than tokens. The earliest scribes served as lawyers and accountants in the early cities. They would record trade transactions, debts, and advances, in duplicate on clay tablets to be retained by the parties to the transaction. The earliest texts were pictographs on tablets written with a stylus, with accounting-specific writing systems evolving into more expressive systems that described politics, religion, and news.</p>
<p>Many commodities were exchanged in the early barter communities—silver, grain, and so forth based on standardized weighs, and thus establishing an absolute value for any particular item was complex and inexact. Under King Croesus of Lydia (in modern Turkey), the touchstone (mined from local riverbeds) was used to standardize the content of gold alloys, allowing standardized coinage and a single denomination for the price of any item. The earliest coins were blank droplets of metal of standard weight, issued by the treasury; later coins were stamped with punches for easy accounting. It was the custom of unmarried ladies in Lydia to sell their virtue in exchange for coins, in order to accumulate a dowry sufficient for them to marry. In this regard, accounting can credibly lay claim to being “the oldest profession.”</p>
<p>The Kingdom of Lydia was short lived; but their idea of standardized coinage lived on, first in the Athenian silver drachma, and later the Roman Solidus, which provided Mediterranean trade with an unprecedented assurance of quality and value for a num.raire commodity—one which could be traded with all others. Issuing standardized coinage was a profitable business for government. Governments essentially take out non-interest bearing loans on the money they mint; in turn, this begot profitable industries in money changing, accepting deposits, and lending money at interest. Rome developed sophisticated financial and contracting systems for transport and trade, far-reaching tax collection, and a vast bureaucratic network.</p>
<p>Parallel developments in Asia saw China evolve from Cowry shells as standard coinage in the .fth century BCE, to copper coins in the Qin Dynasty period (third century BCE). Qin coins were practical—round with a square hole in the middle (for stringing together), which remained the common design for most Chinese copper coins until the twentieth century. Because of the low value of the coinage, seigniorage and government profits were substantial, as was the tax on transactions. The Qin Dynasty took a no nonsense attitude toward executing anyone caught making transactions with local coins, or any currency not sanctioned by the government; a policy revived in the Tang Dynasty when they introduced paper (tree bark) currencies.</p>
<p>The Roman Empire sank into medieval chaos after about the third century. Predicting the collapse of civilization, Boethius and Cassiodorus in the sixth century collected existing studies in mathematics (including accounting) into the quadrivium, comprising the four subjects of arithmetic, geometry, music, and astronomy. These were to be taught to Roman patricians in the monastic schools, which before Saint Benedict of Nursia were more or less safe country estates for offspring of the Roman elite. Until the fifteenth century, European accounting was static and unchanged from the Roman practices. Meanwhile in the Middle East, firstly the Umayyad Caliphate, and then the Abbasid Caliphate of Baghdad rapidly gained power over Central Asia by adopting our modern Arabic number system from India. This was a substantial improvement over the cumbersome notation of the Romans. It allowed easier additions and subtractions, as well as allowing accounting to extend itself to multiplication (for prices and cost allocations) and division (for rates). Baghdad became the world’s center of accounting innovations.</p>
<section id="al-khwarizmi-algebra-of-double-entry" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="al-khwarizmi-algebra-of-double-entry">Al-Khwarizmi Algebra of Double-Entry</h3>
<p>In the Islamic world, the word account took on religious significance, relating to one’s obligation to account to God on all matters pertaining to human endeavor. According to the Qur’an, followers are required to keep records of their indebtedness. Thus Islam provides general approval and guidelines for the recording and reporting of transactions. The Islamic law of inheritance de.nes exactly how the estate is calculated after death of an individual. The power of testamentary disposition is basically limited to one-third of the net estate (i.e., the assets remaining after the payment of funeral expenses and debts), providing for every member of the family by allotting fixed shares not only to wives and children but also to fathers and mothers. Clearly this requires ratios, multiplication, and division that were well beyond the scope of Roman numerals and abaci.</p>
<p>The complexity of Islamic inheritance law served as an impetus behind the development of algebra by medieval Islamic mathematicians. Al-Khwarizm.’s “The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing” devoted a chapter on the solution to the Islamic law of inheritance using linear equations. In the twelfth century, Latin translations of al.Khwarizm.’s “Book of Addition and Subtraction According to the Hindu Calculation” on the use of Indian numerals, introduced the decimal positional number system to the Western world. Hindu.Arabic numerals and algebra were introduced to Europe from Arab mathematics at the end of the tenth century by Pope Sylvester II and in the twelfth century by Fibonacci.</p>
<p>Al-Khwarizm. (Latinized as Algorithmi from which we derived the word “algorithm”) introduced algebra (from the Arabic al-jabr meaning “restoration”) to accounting, leading to three fundamental accounting − algebreic concepts:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><em>Debits = Credits:</em> The “Bookkeeping equation” for error control, which is the accounting equivalent of algebraic manipulations on the left-hand and right-hand side of an equation.</li>
<li><em>Assets = Liabilities + Owner’sEquity:</em> “Real” accounts for tracking wealth, and the “basic accounting equation.” An elaborate form of this equation is presented in a balance sheet that lists all assets, liabilities, and equity, as well as totals to ensure that it balances.</li>
<li><em>Closing process</em> where “Nominal” accounts for tracking activity are closed to Owner’sEquity: Closing out these accounts at year end yields the net income (the owner’s increment in wealth)—arguably the most important single statistic produced in the accounting process.</li>
</ol>
<p>Algebra manipulates formulas around an equal sign, the only constraint being the formula on the right of the equal sign must have the same value as the formula on the left. Double-entry bookkeeping manipulates debit and credit balances around an equal sign, the only constraint being that the debits must have the same value as the credits. Accounting is applied algebra.</p>
<p>Though not specific in this regard, Al-Khwarizm.’s book hinted at what were to become the standards for later accounting: error control (through double-entry), nominal accounts (which appear on the Income Statement) and real accounts (which appear on the Balance Sheet). Nominal accounts are revenue or expense accounts that are closed to a zero balance at the end of each accounting period. They start with a zero balance at the beginning of a new accounting period, accumulate balances during the period, and return to zero at the year end by means of closing entries. Nominal accounts are income statement accounts and are also called “temporary accounts” in contrast to balance sheet (asset, liability, and owners’ equity) accounts that are called “permanent accounts” or “real accounts.” Real accounts are asset, liability, reserve, and capital accounts that appear on a balance sheet. The balances of real accounts are not canceled out at the end of an accounting period but are carried over to the next period.</p>
<p>Al-Khwarizm.’s method was an immediate hit and was widely disseminated throughout the educated world. In 756, the Abbasid Caliph Al-Mansur sent 4000 Arab mercenaries to assist the Chinese Tang Dynasty in the An Shi Rebellion. After the war, they remained in China and established an alliance with the Tang court where they were known as the Black-robed Arabs. The Tang Dynasty brought in Arab scholars and adopted Abbasid innovations in money and accounting. Trade .ourished: the Tangs reopened the Silk Road and hugely expanded their maritime presence into the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea, into Persia, Mesopotamia, (sailing up the Euphrates River in modern-day Iraq), into Arabia, Egypt, Ethiopia, and Somalia in the Horn of Africa. They established the most extensive taxation system to date. Each citizen was taxed on iron and salt usage and owed the Dynasty corvfie labor of 20 days a year. The state practiced the “equal-field system” in which most land was state owned and granted to individual farmers to prevent the formation of large estates. This allowed greater government control over the individual farmers but required a huge professional bureaucracy, including accountants selected by Imperial examination. The banknote was first developed in China in the Tang Dynasty during the seventh century, with local issues of paper currency. Its roots were in merchant receipts of deposit as merchants and wholesalers desired to avoid the heavy bulk of copper coinage in large commercial transactions. The Tang Dynasty paid local merchants with money certificates called “flying cash,” because of its tendency to blow away. These certificates bearing different amounts of money could be converted into hard cash on demand at the capital. Since they were transferable, they were exchanged among merchants almost like currency. The threat of penalties and possibly execution also encouraged merchants to use “.ying cash.”</p>
<p>Abbasid and Tang innovations in accounting would have been much less influential were it not for the rise of the Mongol conqueror Genghis Khan and later his grandson Kublai Khan who were deeply in.uenced by the bureaucracy of the Tang Dynasty. Genghis and his progeny nearly conquered the known world in the thirteenth century. Germany lost nearly a million soldiers (most of its adult males) defending Europe against their invasion. Genghis Khan gave his accountants an unprecedented position of power in the Mongol Empire. When a city was sacked by Mongols, the accountants were the first to enter, tallying up the total asset value of the city (before soldiers could loot or pillage) from which the Mongols took 10%, to be allocated between the troops on well defined principles. Conquered cities were subjugated, then encouraged to remain going-concerns, so that they could be reliably tithed—in this the accountants also played a pivotal role.</p>
<p>The Caliphate of Baghdad had provided fertile ground for the advancement of mathematics at a time that Europe was stuck in the quadrivium. Many of the ancient libraries of Rome and Greece had been transferred to Baghdad, where scholars integrated the Hindu numerical notation into geometry and the algebra of linear and quadratic equations. These works were disseminated throughout the Abbasid Caliphate, including into Moorish Spain, making this body of knowledge accessible to Europeans in the colleges at Granada, Cordova, and Seville around the beginning of the twelfth century. The Italian mathematician Fibonacci became exposed to this knowledge traveling extensively throughout Egypt, Syria, Greece, and Sicily. He eventually returned to Italy to publish his Liber Abbaci (book of calculation), which promoted the use of Arabic numerals for calculations. The book was written in Latin during the year 1202 and was influential and widely read.</p>
<p>The introduction of double-entry bookkeeping into Europe is an interesting one in itself. Arabic numerals were known in Europe, but it was considered sinful to use them. For example, the statutes of the Arte del Cambio of 1299 prohibited the bankers of Florence from using Arabic numerals (even though they had been slipping them into documents since the tenth century just to ease calculations). Pope Sylvester II who reigned for three years at the turn of the millennium, endorsed and promoted study of Arabic arithmetic, mathematics, and astronomy, reintroducing the abacus to Europe. After his death, he was widely denounced as a sorcerer in league with the devil for exactly this reason.</p>
<p>It was into this politically and religiously charged atmosphere that the innovations in Fibbonaci’s Liber Abbaci started with merchants and bankers synthesizing alternatives to the abacus and daybooks of unwieldy Roman numerals. Fibbonaci himself was a merchant as well as a mathematician. He traveled extensively throughout the Mediterranean as a merchant prior to 1200. Not only did he encourage adoption of the Hindu.Arabic numerals for commercial accounting, but he actually set out an account contrasting completely the Roman .gures versus the Arabic numerals.</p>
<p>Importantly, the Hindu.Arabic system mathematics also covered systems of equations, and these were in addition introduced into Spain by the Moors. From an accounting perspective, the conceptualization of debits and credits provided a generalization at the accounting systems (financial statement) level in addition to details at the transaction (journal entry) level. Equations—by de.nition—require an equality of two sides of the equation—on one side dependent variables, on the other independent. In an exchange transaction there is a natural dichotomization into independent variables (assets) and dependent variables (claims). These are reected in the Latin words debere (to owe) and credere (to entrust), which are the basis for our modern words, debit and credit.</p>
<p>The Hindu.Arabic systems of equations were focused on equilibrium—in the balance sheet at any date, an equilibrium of exchange transactions is preserved. The use of an equilibrium device may at first have been pro forma. But it is easy to see how the change from ad hoc single-entry to equilibrium bookkeeping could lead to a complete double-entry system (particularly given European bankers’ early penchant for slipping Arabic numerals into their financial records, despite the fact that they might be accused of colluding with the devil). Once .gures began to be disposed in a single column, instead of being scattered all over the page and reduced to order only outside the account-book on the abacus or in the mind, then the advantages of having two clearly separated columns, simply to facilitate computation, would quickly become apparent (De Roover 1956, 1955, 1938).</p>

<section id="the-renaissance" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-renaissance">The Renaissance</h3>
<p>For two centuries, during the rise of the great Italian banking centers of Genoa, Florence, and Venice, Italian banking recorded transactions, made loans, issued scripts, and carried on with numerous other financial activities that we would recognize today. Initially they used single-entry recording (date, and account affected), but this proved error prone as transaction volume increased. Fibbonaci’s Liber Abbaci was widely read, and influential. Giovanni di Bicci de’ Medici introduced double-entry bookkeeping for the Medici bank in the fourteenth century. By the end of the fifteenth century, merchant ventures in Venice used this system widely.</p>
<p>The fifteenth century also saw the invention of the printing press in Germany, and affordable, widely available reading glasses from Venetian glassmakers. Leo X’s Vatican was an enthusiastic customer, where printing presses were used to churn out indulgences, and subsequently, Italy became a center of printing, book publishing, and literature. One of the first great texts on mathematics was published by a close friend of Leonardo da Vinci, Venetian Luca Pacioli, in 1494. Summa de Arithmetica, Geometria, Proportioni et Proportionalita (Everything About Arithmetic, Geometry and Proportion) formally described the widely used but still controversial system of double-entry for a much wider audience. Pacioli’s Summa included one chapter titled, Details of Accounting and Recording that popularized the Method of Venice for accounting (an evolution of Al-Khwarizmi’s method). Pacioli’s Summa described the components of bookkeeping as: a memorandum book, journal, and ledger, with the journal and ledger similar to modern equivalents. A trial balance was used when the books were closed. The profit or loss was entered into the capital account to balance the balance sheet. Thanks to Gutenberg’s printing press, Summa was published throughout Europe.</p>
<p>Pacioli’s Summa was translated into the most commonly read vernaculars in Europe and was influential not only in investment and merchant ventures but in accounting in the great estates of Europe. Over the next 400 years it became the standard, in only slightly modi.ed form, for accounting in all realms of business in Europe. Before the Industrial Revolution, China and India were the wealthiest economies in the world. Mughal India’s annual revenues were twenty times that of France. In China, Qianlong demanded that Britain’s ambassador Lord McCartney kowtow and informed him that China was in need of nothing from the West.</p>

<section id="the-industrial-revolution" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-industrial-revolution">The Industrial Revolution</h3>
<p>Europe was only a minor economic player in the world at the start of the Industrial Revolution in the late eighteenth century. England, and specifically Charles II, set out to change that. After the death of Oliver Cromwell in 1658, which resulted in his restoration, one of Charles II first tasks was to set up a body to move mathematics and the science forward in England. The Royal Society of London for Improving Natural Knowledge, known simply as the Royal Society, was founded in November 1660. Members of the Royal Society were initially chosen almost evenly from Parliamentarians, and Monarchists (leading some to believe that the Royal Society may have been a Masonic society). England was the first European country to place science and mathematics at the center of national policy. This was not merely an abstract goal. As a country with growing colonial and industrial ambitions, it needed better tools for navigation (clocks, sextants), for business (accounting, patents, methods), and government (statistics).</p>
<p>Modern businesses grew out of the cottage industries of the day. Home sewing grew into textile mills; mines became larger and more efficient. Goldsmiths’ safes were used to hold the monetary deposits of merchants and others, using gold notes as receipts. These receipts evolved into banknotes and these new bankers loaned money and performed other banking tasks. Adam Smith chronicled the merits of specialization. Stock in businesses allowed operations to grow without limit as the technology became available for greater scale. The Bank of England was founded as a joint stock company and became the central bank of Britain.</p>
<p>Much of Britain’s wealth depended on textiles and specifically the wool trade. The wool of British sheep was highly priced, and sheep owners in the Cotswolds and other areas became rich. Instead of selling all wool to continental merchants, the domestic system of textile manufacturing developed. Small farmers did the spinning, cleaning, and weaving in their homes. About half of the manufactured cloth was exported and a wealthy merchant class developed.</p>
<p>At this time manufacturing productivity levels were similar around the world and changed little over time. But the Industrial Revolution inched Britain’s productivity growth up an average about 2% a year, pushing it to the largest economy in the world at the end of the nineteenth century. The factory system was invented for the textile industry. Power-driven machines required an army of laborers, working long hours at monotonous tasks in unsafe conditions for low wages. By 1800 most cotton manufacturing was done at factories. Cotton provided about half of Britain’s exports well into the nineteenth century. By 1850 over 1900 factories were in the cotton industry with 330,000 workers, about 85% using steam and 15% using water power. The human toll was excruciating—the average age of death for a factory worker in 1800 was 17 (Bryson 2010).</p>
<p>The potter Josiah Wedgwood was keenly interested in the scienti.c advances of his day. It was this interest that underpinned his adoption of its approach and methods to revolutionize the quality of his pottery. His unique glazes began to distinguish his wares from anything else on the market. He was perhaps the most famous potter of all time. He built a successful business, but the depression years of 1770.1772 were financially dif.cult for Wedgewood—demand dropped, inventories rose, and prices had to be cut. He also found that his clerks were embezzling funds, while ignoring debt payments and other paperwork.</p>
<p>Wedgwood turned his creative genius toward a detailed examination of his company’s transactions. He was interested in developing a system that would allow him to quickly discover inefficient operations and to identify sources of overhead. In the process, he discovered a long history of embezzlement by his head clerk. This resulted in a new clerk and weekly accounting reviews. Eventually, Wedgwood was able to calculate detailed costs for materials and labor for each step of manufacturing for each product. Overhead costs were analyzed and allocated to specific products. Wedgwood’s early work in cost accounting in.uenced the understanding of industrial economics, as businessmen discovered that costs to produce some products were considerably more than for others, with profound effects on profitability. Economists evolved concepts of economies of scale and sunk costs. Wedgwood’s own factory started to differentiate markets. Based on his cost accounting, demand became a primary factor for production and pricing. The market could be divided between high-price, high-quality, and high-cost products for elite customers, while a mass market was developed with low-cost and low-price pottery. Technology and mechanization were given roles in economic scaling. Wedgwood’s cost accounting innovations allowed him to survive economic downturns where competitors could not.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-birth-of-modern-auditing">The Birth of Modern Auditing</h3>
<p>At the start of the nineteenth century, eleven Londoners listed their occupation as the archaic “Accomptants.” As industry, mass transportation and capital markets expanded so did the need for accountants. Business regulation increased, and industry was often taxed heavily, promoting the need for professionals. The Bankruptcy Act of 1831 allowed accountants to be appointed “Official Assignees,” the first government recognition of the new profession. A primary role became the preparation of accounts and the balance sheet of public companies. Bankrupt firms were especially likely to use their services, which increasingly served an audit function.</p>
<p>The British Companies Act of 1844 established the incorporation of business by a formal registration process. It required annual appointment of auditors to examine the accounts and balance sheet of all public companies (the role of accountants under the British Companies Act would change substantially over the century). The Companies Act of 1862 required banks to be audited and established the practice of limited cash dividends to be paid only out of profits. By 1900, the audit was the central practice of accountants. The earliest of the Big Six accounting firms were started in mid-nineteenth century London. William Deloitte opened a London firm in 1845. Samuel Price and Edwin Waterhouse formed their partnership in 1849. William Cooper started his firm in 1854, to be joined by his brothers in 1861. William Peat started in 1867. These men were active in establishing the Institute of Accounting in the 1870s, and a royal charter was granted in 1880. With the Institute and professional requirements to become Chartered Accountants, the profession of accountants was firmly established.</p>
<p>Many of the current methods in cost accounting were developed after 1880. The Scienti.c Management analysis of mass production was a major factor. Engineers using job analysis as well as time and motion studies determined “scienti.c” standards of material and labor to produce each unit of output. Complex machines required complex engineering and efficient use of workers to perform specialized and repetitive tasks. Standard costs became a significant ef.ciency measure. Frederick Taylor analyzed the best ways to use labor and machines, and standards were determined to minimize waste. The focus was on cost cutting rather than product quality. Actual costs could be compared to standard costs to measure performance, and the variances between actual and standard costs analyzed to determine potential corrective action. Measuring and allocating overhead costs also were major concerns of Scienti.c Management.</p>
<p>Prior to the 1950s, management used cost accounting information primarily for planning purposes; while operating control normally was based on non-accounting information. For example, Du Pont used ROI for planning, but control was based on factors such as timeliness of delivery to customers and product quality. Multidivisional business organizations became more pronounced, and businesses turned to decoupling—different production processes took place at different sites, perhaps thousands of miles away.</p>

<section id="public-accounting" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="public-accounting">Public Accounting</h3>
<p>Until the nineteenth century, firms tended to be small and raised money from partnerships, short-term bank loans, or profits. New industries from the early nineteenth century including canals, railroads, and utilities needed large amounts of capital from private sources. The English and American organized exchanges which provided the mechanisms for the needed cash. Parliament regulated business and capital markets through British Companies Acts. American regulations were based on state laws, which were not particularly effective, yet by the turn of the twentieth century, America overtook Britain as the leading industrial power in the world. Financiers provided the capital to establish large corporations and combinations and, as demonstrated by J. P. Morgan, maintained substantial power over industries. Insiders bene.ted from price .xing, stock manipulation, and various schemes of questionable legality. Accountants usually aided managers and speculators. Mergers, cutthroat competitions, railroad rebates, and bribery were some of the techniques used by businesses. Beginning with Standard Oil, the trust was used to acquire businesses across state lines. By 1890, 300 trusts controlled 5000 companies. By 1900, the largest dozen trusts had capital of over $1 billion. The investment bankers became directors (78 companies at J. P. Morgan).</p>
<p>Government regulation was demanded by the public, often subject to monopoly pricing and various predatory practices alone. Federal regulations began with the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) Act of 1887 to regulated railroads. Federal antitrust began with the Sherman Act of 1890. Following the panic of 1907, the USA experienced a decade of reform in legislation. The Clayton Act of 1913 prohibited interlocking directorships. The Federal Reserve was established the next year, as was the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).</p>
<p>Disclosure of financial information was voluntary. During the nineteenth and early twentieth century, the balance sheet was paramount. The income statement was neglected because it was open to abuse (no accounting standard regulations existed), and the concept of earnings power had to wait to the post-World War I period. At the turn of the century, the stock exchanges were dominated by the railroad industry (60% of NYSE firms at 1900, for example). They were considered safe investments because they paid fairly consistent dividends—ignoring bankruptcies that did occur in this industry. Industrial firms did catch on in the 1920s (44% of NYSE firms in 1920), and the income statement became more important as industrials tended to pay dividends based on earnings. Unfortunately, the Roaring Twenties also was a time of rampant speculation, with securities bought on credit and with little regard to underlying earnings power. Until 1910, the NYSE had an “unlisted department” for firms that disclosed no financial information. Although 90% of NYSE firms had audits in some form by 1926, audited financial statements were not required until 1933—when stock prices stood at 10% of 1929 highs. Insider trading was common and not illegal; “preferred list” sales of new securities at discounted prices were made before the issues went public; syndicated stock pools manipulated stock prices.</p>
<p>The U.S. economy, which hinged on farming, had been in trouble since the early 1920s. Waves of immigrant farmers plowed increasingly marginal land, creating dustbowls, and impoverishing local banks that lent to them. But since there were no national records, knowledge about the problem was scarce. When the stock market crashed, the regulators panicked. The Federal Reserve cut back the money supply, turning a recession and stock panic into a major depression. From 1929 until 1932, 11,000 banks failed, gross national product fell about 10% a year, steel production dwindled to 12% of capacity, and the unemployment rate hit 25%. The Hawley.Smoot Tariff Act dramatically increased tariffs, with effect being to limit world trade—which effectively made this a global depression. Franklin D. Roosevelt was President Hoover’s opponent in 1932, promising a New Deal. He won in a landslide and delivered. During the first 100 days, a remarkable amount of legislation was passed (some of it a holdover from the Hoover administration). The Glass.Steagall Act separated commercial from investment banking and created the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to insure bank deposits; the Social Security Act established retirement and disability pensions funded with payroll taxes.</p>
<p>New Deal legislation led to federal responsibility for protecting investors from malpractice in the investment markets with the Securities Act of 1933. The Act was modeled on state regulations, British Companies Acts, and earlier Congressional legislation. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Act of 1934 created the SEC to administer the legislation. The Securities Acts required companies to present registration statements with new public offerings of stocks, bonds, and other securities, to make “full and fair” disclosure of financial information. Information relevant to the “prudent investor” was to be disclosed in the registration statement. Antifraud and liability regulations increased the legal responsibilities of accountants, who became liable to the public as well as the management of the firms audited. Modern financial reporting and the development of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) started with this federal legislation. The SEC has the authority to regulate accounting. This was delegated to the private sector and the American Institute of Accountants (AIA— later the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants or AICPA). It gave the Committee on Accounting Procedure (CAP) the responsibility to issue accounting standards in 1938. The CAP’s standards were called Accounting Research Bulletins (ARBs) and from 1938.1959, 51 ARBs were issued. Few ARBs are still in effect, but the basic structure of financial accounting has not changed much from these initial standards. Both the accounting profession and the financial community cited the CAP and this was replaced by the Accounting Principles Board (APB) in 1959. This was another AICPA committee and had many of the same problems. The APB would issue 31 Opinions until they were superseded in 1973.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="emerging-technologies-and-intangible-assets">Emerging Technologies and Intangible Assets</h2>
<p>Information technology plays a pivotal role in financial control and audit today. Most, if not all financial data is now digitally recorded, and dispersed among servers, clouds, and networks of computers, over which the audited firm has no control. Additionally, firm data particularly in finance, IT, insurance, and medicine now comprise most of the audited value of the firm. Financial audits are critical mechanisms ensuring the integrity of information systems and the reporting of organizational finances. They help avoid the abuses that led to passage of legislation such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and the Sarbanes.Oxley Act. They help provide assurance that International Accounting Standards are consistently applied in calculating firm value, while controlling asset market bubbles. Expanding audit challenges have fueled a growth market in auditing throughout the past decade. Both undergraduate and graduate accounting enrollments are at their highest level in the past 40 years, with accounting students making up 40% of business school enrollments (Fig. 1).</p>
<p>Graduate degrees are increasingly important to the profession, around 40% of accounting graduates hired by public accounting firms have graduate degrees. The second largest group and hired into public accounting had degrees in information technology and computer science. The most prestigious of the accounting firms, the largest accounting firms, the Big Four, have increased their intake substantially (Table 1).</p>
<p>The financial information sector of the USA and world economies are major contributors to jobs’ growth and wealth. In 2018, it represented around 15% of the US economy (about 2 trillion dollars) and around 10% of the global economy (around 7 trillion dollars). In addition to accounting firms, large banks, rating agencies, funds, private investment, and many other fields require accounting expertise to function competitively in current markets. Increasingly that means expertise in information technologies as well.</p>
<p>[ Insert Fig.1 ]</p>
<p>Auditors have been grappling for many decades with calls to increase the scope of their audits to non-traditional measures of corporate performance financial forecasts, brand valuations, valuations of intangible assets, social accountability, and so forth. For the most part, they have rebuffed any efforts to expand auditing because of concerns over objectivity and the ability to provide sufficient reliability of their opinions (Aboody and Lev 1998;Lev 2001, 2004).</p>
<p>The stock market valuation of the Fortune 500 companies (which include many traditional industries such as oil and autos) has grown increasingly higher than the accountants book valuations over the past three decades. This is reected in the growth of intangible assets, which may be loosely defined as valuable things the firm owns, like patents, skills, and so forth, that are not explicitly assessed in an audit, nor presented on the financial reports.</p>
<p>Tobin’s q is the ratio between a physical asset’s market value and its replacement value. It was first introduced by Kaldor (1966) and popularized by Nobel Laureate James Tobin. Values are supplied in the Federal Reserve Z.1 Financial Accounts of the United States, which is released quarterly. The average (arithmetic mean) q-Ratio is about 0.70. The chart below shows the q-Ratio relative to its arithmetic mean of 1 (i.e., divided the ratio data points by the average). This gives a more intuitive sense to the numbers. For example, the all-time q-Ratio high at the peak of the Tech Bubble was 1.61—which suggests that the market price was 136% above the historic average of replacement cost. The all-time lows in 1921, 1932 and 1982 were around 0.30, which is approximately 55% below replacement cost. The latest data point is 55% above the mean and now in the vicinity of the range of the historic peaks that preceded the Tech Bubble (Fig. 2).</p>
<p>Since the 1980s, accounting has evolved to focus less on physical things and more on intangibles and information. Information is increasingly the asset of value in firms, and IT provides the tools to manage, process, and deliver information products and services. In 1980, most of firm value was comprised of physical goods accounted for in the financial statements; by 2018, 40.80% of firms value was in unmeasured intangible assets. Much of this intangible value is held in databases, intellectual property, proprietary processes, and individual expertise.</p>
<p>Historically, book value was relatively accurate in assessing the value of a firm—up until the 1970s. The 1970s introduced “financial engineering” as exempli.ed by the conglomerate fad initiated by firms like LTV and Textron. Firms became harder to value from both an investment and an accounting perspective. The 1970s was also a period when Treasury rates approached 15%, and firms were feeling new competition from Asia. This pushed many firms into a negative equity position, which was only remedied by the availability of easy money in the 1980s. Since then, the growth of stock market valuations have steadily outpaced book value, at least partly reecting the growth of intangible “knowledge” assets that are of value to investors but poorly tracked in accounting systems.</p>
<p>Information technology now plays a pivotal role in financial control and audit: most, if not all financial data is now digitally recorded and dispersed among servers, clouds, and networks of computers over which the audited firm has no control. Intellectual property, accounting, finance, IT, and risk data now comprise most of the value of the firm. Financial audits are critical mechanisms ensuring the integrity of information systems and accurate reporting. Over the past 30 years, the information intensive parts of the economy have been consistently more profitable than industries requiring heavy investment</p>

<p>in machinery and other fixed assets. Conclusion: return on investment is strongly correlated with investment in intangible assets.</p>
<p>The value of all the data in America is between $1.5 and $2 trillion, or around 5% of America’s stock of private physical capital. The amount of data in the world has been growing exponentially for decades. The first human genome (three gigabytes of data, which nearly fills a DVD) was sequenced in 2003; by 2020 more than 25 million people had had their genomes sequenced. The latest autonomous vehicles produce up to 30 TB for every 8 hours of driving. IDC estimates that the world will generate over 90 ZB per year in 2020 (1 ZB = 1 trillion billion bytes), more than all data produced since the advent of computers (Figs. 3 and 4).</p>
<p>Data is approximately doubling every 2 years, in 2020, with about 20 trillion bytes of data for every person on earth. Spending on IT hardware, software, services, telecommunications, and staff, that could be considered the “infrastructure” of Big Data, is growing around 40% annually in the USA and China, and approaching that in the rest of the world. There has been a rapid migration of data from local islands of technology such as corporate servers, mainframes, personal computers, and portable devices toward data investment in targeted areas like storage management, security, and cloud computing. Data management often centers around the partitioning of data residence between “edge” computers and “cloud” servers.</p>
<p>The mode in which data is presented has changed dramatically over the past century. Most digitized data was in columnar spreadsheet format up through the 1980s. Increased bandwidth, storage, and processing power has allowed richer formats to dominate over the past two decades. Much of the information needed for effective auditing is now encapsulated in these more complex modalities.</p>
<p>Much of the growth in data has been driven by user creation through social networks and multimedia (videos, pictures, music). There is also a rapid growth in transient data. Phone calls that are not recorded, digital TV images that are consumed but not saved, packets temporarily stored in routers, digital surveillance images purged from memory when new images come in, and so forth.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="financial-accounting">Financial Accounting</h3>
<p>Accountancy is the process of communicating financial information about a business entity to users such as shareholders and managers. 会計は、株主や経営者などのユーザーに対して、事業体に関する財務情報を伝達するプロセスです。 The communication is generally in the form of financial statements that show, in money terms, the economic resources under the control of management; the art lies in selecting the information that is relevant to the user and is reliable. そのコミュニケーションは、経営陣の管理下にある経済的資源を金銭的に示す財務諸表の形で一般的に行われます。 この技術は財務諸表利用者にとって重要で信頼性のある情報を選択することにあります。 The principles of accountancy are applied to business entities in three divisions of practical art, named accounting, bookkeeping, and auditing. 会計の原則は、会計、簿記、監査という3つの技術の部門に適用されます。 Accounting is defined by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) as “the art of recording, classifying, and summarizing in a significant manner and in terms of money, transactions and events which are, in part at least, of financial character, and interpreting the results thereof.” 会計は、米国公認会計士協会（AICPA）によって「金銭的な性格の一部である取引や事象を記録、分類、要約し、その結果を解釈する」と定義されています。 Today, accounting is called “the language of business” because it is the vehicle for reporting financial information about a business entity to many different groups of people. 今日、会計は「ビジネスの言語」と呼ばれています。なぜなら、それは事業体に関する財務情報を多くの異なるグループの人々に報告するための手段だからです。 Accounting that concentrates on reporting to people inside the business entity is called management accounting and is used to provide information to employees, managers, owner-managers, and auditors. 組織内の人々に報告することに焦点を当てた会計は管理会計と呼ばれ、従業員、マネージャー、オーナーマネージャー、監査人に情報を提供するために使用されます。 Management accounting is concerned primarily with providing a basis for making management or operating decisions. 管理会計は、主に管理または運営上の意思決定の基盤を提供することに関心があります。 Accounting that provides information to people outside the business entity is called financial accounting and provides information to present and potential shareholders, creditors such as banks or vendors, financial analysts, economists, and government agencies. 組織外の人々に情報を提供する会計は財務会計と呼ばれ、現在および将来の株主、銀行やベンダーなどの債権者、金融アナリスト、経済学者、政府機関に情報を提供します。 Because these users have different needs, the presentation of financial accounts is very structured and subject to many more rules than management accounting. これらのユーザーは異なるニーズを持っているため、財務諸表の提示は非常に構造化されており、管理会計よりも多くの規則に従っています。 The body of rules that governs financial accounting in a given jurisdiction is called Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP. 特定の管轄区域で財務会計を規制する規則体系を一般に受け入れられた会計原則、またはGAAPと呼びます。 Other rules include International Financial Reporting Standards, or IFRS, or US GAAP. その他の規則には、国際財務報告基準（IFRS）または米国GAAPが含まれます。 Accounting standards have historically been set by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) subject to Securities and Exchange Commission regulations. 会計基準は、証券取引委員会の規制に従う米国公認会計士協会（AICPA）によって歴史的に設定されてきました。 The AICPA first created the Committee on Accounting Procedure in 1939 and replaced that with the Accounting Principles Board in 1951. AICPAは1939年に会計手続委員会を設立し、1951年に会計原則委員会に置き換えました。 In 1973, the Accounting Principles Board was replaced by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) under the supervision of the Financial Accounting Foundation with the Financial Accounting Standards Advisory Council serving to advise and provide input on the accounting standards. 1973年、会計原則委員会は、会計基準に関する助言を提供し、入力を提供するための財務会計基準諮問委員会を監督する財団の監督下にある財務会計基準委員会（FASB）に置き換えられました。 Other organizations involved in determining United States’ accounting standards include the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB), formed in 1984, and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB). 米国の会計基準を決定する他の組織には、1984年に設立された政府会計基準委員会（GASB）と公開会社会計監査監督委員会（PCAOB）が含まれます。</p>
<p>In 2008, the FASB issued the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, which reorganized the thousands of US GAAP pronouncements into roughly 90 accounting topics. 2008年、FASBはFASB会計基準コーディネーションを発行し、数千の米国GAAP声明を約90の会計トピックに再編しました。 In 2008, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued a preliminary “roadmap” that may lead the USA to abandon Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the future and to join more than 100 countries around the world instead of using the London-based International Financial Reporting Standards. 2008年、証券取引委員会は、将来米国が一般に受け入れられた会計原則を放棄し、ロンドンを拠点とする国際財務報告基準の代わりに世界中の100か国以上に参加する可能性がある「ロードマップ」を発行しました。 As of 2010, the convergence project was underway with the FASB meeting routinely with the IASB. 2010年時点で、FASBは定期的にIASBと会合を開催していました。 The SEC expressed their aim to fully adopt International Financial Reporting Standards in the USA by 2014. SECは、2014年までに米国で国際財務報告基準を完全に採用することを目指していました。 With the convergence of the US GAAP and the international IFRS accounting systems, as the highest authority over International Financial Reporting Standards, the International Accounting Standards Board is becoming more important in the US. US GAAPと国際IFRS会計システムのコンバージェンスにより、国際財務報告基準の最高機関として、国際会計基準委員会は米国でますます重要になっています。</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-products-of-accounting-financial-statements">The Products of Accounting: Financial Statements</h2>
<p>There are four main financial statements. 主要な財務諸表は4つあります。 They are (1) balance sheets, (2) income statements, (3) cash flow statements, and (4) statements of shareholders’ equity. それらは、(1) 貸借対照表、(2) 損益計算書、(3) キャッシュフロー計算書、および(4) 株主資本等変動計算書です。</p>
<p>Balance sheets show what a company owns and what it owes at a fixed point in time. 貸借対照表は、特定の時点で会社が所有しているものと借りているものを示します。 Income statements show how much money a company made and spent over a period of time. 損益計算書は、一定期間内に会社がいくらの収入を得ていくらの支出をしたかを示します。 Cash flow statements show the exchange of money between a company and the outside world also over a period of time. キャッシュフロー計算書は、一定期間内に会社と外部世界との間でのお金のやり取りを示します。 The fourth financial statement, called a “statement of shareholders’ equity,” shows changes in the interests of the company’s shareholders over time. 4番目の財務諸表である「株主資本等変動計算書」は、会社の株主の利益に変化があったことを示します。</p>
<section id="the-balance-sheet" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-balance-sheet">The Balance Sheet</h3>
<p>A balance sheet provides detailed information about a company’s assets, liabilities, and shareholders’ equity. Assets are things that a company owns that have value. 貸借対照表は、会社の資産、負債、株主資本についての詳細な情報を提供します。資産とは、価値のある会社が所有するものです。 This typically means they can either be sold or used by the company to make products or provide services that can be sold. 通常、これは、それらが売却されるか、会社が製品を製造したりサービスを提供したりして売却できることを意味します。 Assets include physical property, such as plants, trucks, equipment, and inventory. 資産には、工場、トラック、機器、在庫などの物理的な財産が含まれます。 It also includes things that cannot be touched but nevertheless exist and have value, such as trademarks and patents. 商標や特許など、触れることはできないが存在し価値があるものも含まれます。 And cash itself is an asset. そして現金自体も資産です。</p>
<p>So are investments a company makes. 会社が行う投資も資産です。 Liabilities are amounts of money that a company owes to others. 負債とは、会社が他者に支払う金額です。 This can include all kinds of obligations, like money borrowed from a bank to launch a new product, rent for use of a building, money owed to suppliers for materials, payroll a company owes to its employees, environmental cleanup costs, or taxes owed to the government. これには、新製品を立ち上げるために銀行から借りたお金、建物の使用料、材料の供給業者に支払うお金、従業員に支払う給与、環境浄化費用、政府に支払う税金など、さまざまな義務が含まれます。 Liabilities also include obligations to provide goods or services to customers in the future. 負債には、将来顧客に商品やサービスを提供する義務も含まれます。 Shareholders’ equity is sometimes called capital or net worth. 株主資本は、時に資本または純資産とも呼ばれます。 It is the money that would be left if a company sold all of its assets and paid off all of its liabilities. これは、会社がすべての資産を売却し、すべての負債を返済した場合に残るお金です。 This leftover money belongs to the shareholders, or the owners, of the company. この残りのお金は、会社の株主または所有者に属します。 A company’s balance sheet is set up like the basic accounting equation shown above. 会社の貸借対照表は、上記に示されている基本的な会計式のように設定されています。 On the left side of the balance sheet, companies list their assets. 貸借対照表の左側には、会社が資産をリストします。 On the right side, they list their liabilities and shareholders’ equity. 右側には、負債と株主資本がリストされます。 Sometimes balance sheets show assets at the top, followed by liabilities, with shareholders’ equity at the bottom. 貸借対照表は、資産を上部に表示し、次に負債を表示し、最後に株主資本を表示することがあります。 Assets are generally listed based on how quickly they will be converted into cash. 資産は、通常、どれだけ速く現金に換金されるかに基づいてリストされます。 Current assets are things a company expects to convert to cash within 1 year. 流動資産は、会社が1年以内に現金に換金することを期待しているものです。</p>
<p>A good example is inventory. 良い例は在庫です。 Most companies expect to sell their inventory for cash within 1 year. ほとんどの企業は、1年以内に在庫を現金で売却することを期待しています。 Noncurrent assets are things a company does not expect to convert to cash within 1 year or that would take longer than 1 year to sell. 流動資産は、1年以内に現金に換金されることを期待しているものです。 Noncurrent assets include fixed assets. 固定資産には、トラック、オフィス家具、その他の資産など、ビジネスを運営するために使用される資産が含まれます。 Fixed assets are those assets used to operate the business but that are not available for sale, such as trucks, of.ce furniture, and other property. 固定資産とは、ビジネスを運営するために使用されるが売却可能でない資産のことです。 Liabilities are generally listed based on their due dates. 負債は、通常、支払期日に基づいてリストされます。 Liabilities are said to be either current or long term. 負債は、流動負債または長期負債と言われます。 Current liabilities are obligations a company expects to pay off within the year. 流動負債は、会社が1年以内に支払いを完了することを期待している義務です。 Long-term liabilities are obligations due more than 1 year away. 長期負債は、1年以上先に支払われる義務です。</p>
<p>Shareholders’ equity is the amount owners invested in the company’s stock, plus or minus the company’s earnings or losses since inception. 株主資本は、株主が会社の株式に投資した金額に、設立以来の会社の利益または損失をプラスまたはマイナスしたものです。 Sometimes companies distribute earnings, instead of retaining them. 時には、会社は利益を配当として配布します。 These distributions are called dividends. これらの配当は配当と呼ばれます。 A balance sheet shows a snapshot of a company’s assets, liabilities, and shareholders’ equity at the end of the reporting period. 貸借対照表は、報告期間の終わりに会社の資産、負債、株主資本のスナップショットを示します。 It does not show the .ows into and out of the accounts during the period. 期間中の口座への流入と流出を示しません。</p>

<p>An income statement is a report that shows how much revenue a company earned over a specific time period (usually for a year or some portion of a year). 損益計算書は、会社が特定の期間（通常1年または1年の一部）にいくらの収入を得たかを示すレポートです。 An income statement also shows the costs and expenses associated with earning that revenue. 損益計算書は、その収入を得るためにかかるコストと費用も示します。 The literal “bottom line” of the statement usually shows the company’s net earnings or losses. レポートの文字通りの「最終行」は、通常、会社の純利益または損失を示します。 This tells you how much the company earned or lost over the period. これは、会社がその期間にいくら稼いだか、または失ったかを示します。 Income statements also report earnings per share (or “EPS”). 損益計算書は、1株当たりの利益（EPS）も報告します。 This calculation tells you how much money shareholders would receive if the company decided to distribute all of the net earnings for the period. この計算は、会社がその期間のすべての純利益を配当することを決定した場合、株主が受け取る金額を示します。</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="cash-flow-statements">Cash Flow Statements</h3>
<p>Cash flow statements report a company’s inflow and outflow of cash. キャッシュフロー計算書は、会社の現金の流入と流出を報告します。 This is important because a company needs to have enough cash on hand to pay its expenses and purchase assets. これは重要です。なぜなら、会社は経費を支払い、資産を購入するために十分な現金を手元に置いておく必要があるからです。 While an income statement can tell you whether a company made a profit, a cash flow statement can tell you whether the company generated cash. 損益計算書は、会社が利益を上げたかどうかを示すことができますが、キャッシュフロー計算書は、会社が現金を生み出したかどうかを示すことができます。 A cash flow statement shows changes over time rather than absolute dollar amounts at a point in time. キャッシュフロー計算書は、時間の経過とともに変化を示すものであり、特定の時点での絶対ドル額ではありません。 It uses and reorders the information from a company’s balance sheet and income statement. 会社の貸借対照表と損益計算書からの情報を使用して並べ替えます。 Cash Flow Statements may be generalized to Working Capital Statements, which replace cash in the calculations, with more general Current Assets and Current Liabilities, both of which are expected to expire within the operating cycle (typically 1 year) and thus are what would be called “near-cash.” The bottom line of the cash flow statement shows the net increase or decrease in cash for the period. キャッシュフロー計算書は、キャッシュを計算から取り除き、より一般的な流動資産と流動負債に置き換える作業資本計算書に一般化されることがあります。これらは、運転サイクル（通常1年）内に期限切れとなると予想される流動資産と流動負債であり、したがって「現金に近い」と呼ばれるものです。キャッシュフロー計算書の最終行は、その期間の現金の純増または純減を示します。 Cash flow statements are divided into three main parts. キャッシュフロー計算書は、3つの主要な部分に分かれています。 Each part reviews the cash flow from one of three types of activities: (1) operating activities, (2) investing activities, and (3) financing activities. 各部分は、3つのタイプの活動のうち1つからのキャッシュフローをレビューします：(1) 運用活動、(2) 投資活動、(3) 財務活動。</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-methodology-of-accounting">The Methodology of Accounting</h2>
<p>Financial accounting is the vehicle through which firms can record and report important economic transactions that affect their wealth. 財務会計は、企業が自らの富に影響を与える重要な経済取引を記録し報告できる手段です。 It is a quasi-axiomatic system where fundamental “principles” are loosely applied to the recording of economic events (transactions) that affect firm wealth. これは、基本的な「原則」が企業の富に影響を与える経済的イベント（取引）の記録に緩く適用される準公理的システムです。 These detailed transactions are summarized into accounts based on a firm-specific classi.cation called the Chart of Accounts. これらの詳細な取引は、勘定科目と呼ばれる企業固有の分類に基づいて集計されます。 The accounts are further organized and summarized for reporting in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). これらの勘定科目は、一般に受け入れられた会計原則（GAAP）に従って報告するためにさらに整理され要約されます。 The accounting perspective in practice today derives from Al-Khwarizmi’s eighth century system of algebraic balancing and arithmetic manipulation. 現在の実践の会計視点は、アル＝ワリズミの8世紀の代数的バランスと算術操作のシステムに由来します。 The system is inherently linear—prices and costs are assumed to be additive and generally are considered fixed across transactions. このシステムは本質的に線形です。価格とコストは加法的であると仮定され、通常、取引を超えて固定されていると考えられています。 But in practice, many economic processes are non-linear and data may be incomplete and inaccurate. しかし、実際には、多くの経済プロセスは非線形であり、データは不完全で不正確である可能性があります。 Consequently, modern accounting reports are economic approximations that are made to facilitate tractability and scalability in accounting systems. したがって、現代の会計報告は、会計システムの追跡性と拡張性を容易にするために行われる経済的近似値です。 The perspective adopted by modern auditors reects trade-offs made in accounting reports, and many standard audit procedures accommodate the inherent uncertainty of financial accounting. 現代の監査人が採用する視点は、会計報告で行われるトレードオフを反映しており、多くの標準的な監査手続きは財務会計の固有の不確実性に適応しています。</p>
<section id="generally-accepted-accounting-principles-gaap" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="generally-accepted-accounting-principles-gaap">Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP)</h3>
<p>Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) refer to the standard framework of guidelines for financial accounting used in any given jurisdiction, generally known as accounting standards. 一般に受け入れられた会計原則（GAAP）とは、特定の管轄区域で使用される財務会計のためのガイドラインの標準的な枠組みを指します。一般的に会計基準として知られています。 GAAP includes the standards, conventions, and rules accountants follow in recording and summarizing, and in the preparation of financial statements. Financial Accounting is information that must be assembled and reported objectively. GAAPには、会計士が記録および要約し、財務諸表を作成する際に従う基準、慣習、および規則が含まれます。財務会計は、客観的に集められ報告される情報です。 Third-parties who must rely on such information have a right to be assured that the data is free from bias and inconsistency, whether deliberate or not. このような情報に依存しなければならない第三者は、意図的であろうとなかろうと、データが偏見や不一致から解放されていることを保証される権利があります。 For this reason, financial accounting relies on GAAP. このため、財務会計はGAAPに依存しています。 Principles derive from tradition, such as the concept of matching. 原則は、マッチングの概念などの伝統から派生しています。 In any report of financial statements (audit, compilation, review, etc.), the preparer/auditor must indicate to the reader whether or not the information contained within the statements complies with GAAP. 財務諸表（監査、編纂、レビューなど）のいずれかの報告では、作成者/監査人は、諸表に含まれる情報がGAAPに準拠しているかどうかを読者に示さなければなりません。</p>

<p>The basic accounting equation is <span class="math inline">\(assets = liabilities + stockholders’ equity\)</span>. 基本的な会計式は、<span class="math inline">\(資産 = 負債 + 株主資本\)</span>です。 This is the balance sheet. これが貸借対照表です。 The foundation for the balance sheet begins with the income statement, which is revenues − expenses = net income or net loss. 貸借対照表の基礎は、収益 - 費用 = 純利益または純損失である損益計算書から始まります。 This is followed by the retained earnings statement, which is beginning retained earnings + net income − dividends = ending retained earnings or beginning retained earnings − net loss − dividends = ending retained earnings. これに続くのは、保有利益計算書で、初期保有利益 + 純利益 - 配当 = 期末保有利益または初期保有利益 - 純損失 - 配当 = 期末保有利益です。</p>

<li><strong>Accounting Entity:</strong> assumes that the business is separate from its owners or other businesses. Revenue and expense should be kept separate from personal expenses. 会計的実態：事業が所有者や他の事業とは別であると仮定します。収益と費用は個人の支出とは別に保持されるべきです。</li>
<li><strong>Going Concern:</strong> assumes that the business will be in operation inde.nitely. This validates the methods of asset capitalization, depreciation, and amortization. only when liquidation is certain is this assumption not applicable. 継続企業の前提：事業が無期限に運営されると仮定します。これは、資産の資本化、減価償却、および償却の方法を有効化します。清算が確実な場合にのみ、この前提は適用されません。</li>

<section id="principles" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="principles">Principles</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Historical cost principle requires companies to account and report based on acquisition costs rather than fair market value for most assets and liabilities. 歴史的原価原則は、企業に対して、ほとんどの資産と負債について、取得原価に基づいて会計および報告することを要求します。 This principle provides information that is reliable (removing opportunity to provide subjective and potentially biased market values), but not very relevant. この原則は、信頼性のある情報を提供します（主観的であり、潜在的にバイアスのある市場価値を提供する機会を排除します）、しかし、非常に関連性がありません。 Thus there is a trend to use fair values. したがって、公正価値を使用する傾向があります。 Most debts and securities are now reported at market values. ほとんどの債務と証券は現在、市場価値で報告されています。</p></li>
<li><p>Revenue recognition principle requires companies to record when revenue is (1) realized or realizable and (2) earned, not when cash is received. 収益認識原則は、収益が（1）実現または実現可能であり、（2）獲得されたときに記録することを企業に要求します。現金を受け取ったときではありません。 This way of accounting is called accrual basis accounting. この会計方法は、発生主義会計と呼ばれます。</p></li>
<li><p>Matching principle. 対応原則 Expenses have to be matched with revenues as long as it is reasonable to do so. 費用は、合理的である限り、収益と対応させる必要があります。 Expenses are recognized not when the work is performed, or when a product is produced, but when the work or the product actually makes its contribution to revenue. 費用は、作業が実行されたとき、または製品が製造されたときではなく、作業または製品が実際に収益に貢献したときに認識されます。 Only if no connection with revenue can be established, cost may be charged as expenses to the current period (e.g., of.ce salaries and other administrative expenses). 収益との関連が確立されない場合にのみ、コストは現在の期間（たとえば、オフィス給与およびその他の管理費）の費用として請求される可能性があります。 This principle allows greater evaluation of actual profitability and performance (shows how much was spent to earn revenue). Depreciation and Cost of Goods Sold are good examples of application of this principle. この原則は、実際の収益性とパフォーマンスの評価を可能にします（収益を得るためにいくら費やされたかを示します）。減価償却費および売上原価は、この原則の適用の良い例です。</p></li>
<li><p>Full Disclosure principle. 完全開示原則 Amount and kinds of information disclosed should be decided based on trade-off analysis as a larger amount of information costs more to prepare and use. 開示される情報の量と種類は、準備および使用にかかるコストが高くなるため、トレードオフ分析に基づいて決定されるべきです。 Information disclosed should be enough to make a judgment while keeping costs reasonable. Information is presented in the main body of financial statements, in the notes or as supplementary information. 開示される情報は、判断を下すのに十分でありながら、コストを合理的に保つべきです。情報は、財務諸表の本文、注釈、または補足情報として提示されます。</p></li>

<p>Al Khwarizmi’s algebraic method of balancing accounting entries developed into the standards for error control, nominal accounts, and real accounts that became universal in accounting. アル＝ワリズミの代数的な会計エントリのバランス方法は、会計で普遍的になったエラーコントロール、名義口座、実口座の標準に発展しました。 By the twelfth century, Fibonacci had codi.ed and circulated these in Latin. 12世紀までに、フィボナッチはこれらをラテン語でコーディングし、流通させました。 This work was popularized by another Italian, Luca Pacioli, in the fifteenth century in one of the first printed and widely distributed texts on business mathematics. この作業は、15世紀の別のイタリア人、ルカ・パチョーリによって普及し、ビジネス数学に関する最初の印刷され広く流通したテキストの1つになりました。 This is the double-entry bookkeeping method we use today, which is conceived in terms of debits and credits. Pacioli’s most important contributions were これが、現在使用されている借方と貸方の概念で構想された複式簿記法です。パチョーリの最も重要な貢献は次のとおりです。</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>In deciding which account has to be debited and which account has to be credited, the processes of balancing and completion follow the accounting equation: Equity = Assets − Liabilities. どの勘定科目が借方になり、どの勘定科目が貸方になるかを決定する際、バランスと完了のプロセスは、会計式：株主資本 = 資産 - 負債に従います。</li>
<li>The accounting equation serves as an error detection tool. If at any point, the sum of debits for all accounts does not equal the corresponding sum of credits for all accounts, an error has occurred. 会計式はエラー検出ツールとして機能します。すべての勘定科目の借方の合計がすべての勘定科目の対応する貸方の合計と等しくない場合、エラーが発生したことになります。</li>
<li>In the double-entry accounting system, each accounting entry records related pairs of financial transactions for asset, liability, income, expense, or capital accounts. 複式簿記システムでは、各会計エントリは、資産、負債、収益、費用、または資本勘定の関連するペアの財務取引を記録します。</li>
<li>A document file that records economic events that result in an increase or decrease in wealth of the firm is called a Journal, and the transaction is the Journal Entry. 会社の富の増加または減少につながる経済的イベントを記録する文書ファイルを帳簿と呼び、取引は仕訳です。</li>
<li>Pacioli’s term for a Journal is a “Daybook”—a term that was used up to the twentieth century in accounting. パチョーリの帳簿に対する用語は「日記帳」であり、20世紀まで会計で使用されていました。</li>
</ol>
<p>The system popularized by Pacioli has become the standard fare for introductory accounting courses around the world. パチョーリによって普及したシステムは、世界中の初級会計コースの標準的な内容になりました。 For the purpose of the accounting equation approach, all the accounts are classi.ed into the following five types: assets, liabilities, income/revenues, expenses, or capital gains/losses. 会計式アプローチの目的のために、すべての勘定科目は、資産、負債、収入/収益、費用、または資本利益/損失の5つのタイプに分類されます。 If there is an increase or decrease in one account, there will be equal decrease or increase in another account. 1つの勘定科目に増加または減少がある場合、他の勘定科目にも同じだけの減少または増加があります。</p>

<p>Each financial transaction is recorded in at least two different real ledger accounts within the financial accounting system, so that the total debits equals the total credits in the general ledger, i.e., the accounts balance. 財務上の仕訳は、少なくとも2つの異なる実勘定科目に記録されるため、総借方が総貸方と等しくなり、つまり勘定がバランスします。 The transaction is recorded as a “debit entry” (Dr.) in one account, and a “credit entry” (Cr.) in a second account. 取引は、1つの勘定科目に「借方エントリ」（Dr.）として記録され、2番目の勘定科目に「貸方エントリ」（Cr.）として記録されます。 The debit entry will be recorded on the debit side (left-hand side) of a general ledger, and the credit entry will be recorded on the credit side (right-hand side) of a general ledger account. 借方エントリは、総勘定元帳の借方（左側）に記録され、貸方エントリは、総勘定元帳の貸方（右側）に記録されます。 If the total of the entries on the debit side of one account is greater than the total on the credit side of the same real account, that account is said to have a debit balance. 1つの勘定科目の借方側のエントリの合計が、同じ実勘定科目の貸方側の合計よりも大きい場合、その勘定科目は借方残高と言われます。 Double-entry is used only in real ledgers. 複式簿記は、実勘定科目のみで使用されます。 It is not used in journals (daybooks), which normally do not form part of the real ledger system. 通常、実勘定科目システムの一部を形成しない日記（日記帳）では使用されません。 The information from the journals will be used in the general ledger and it is the real ledgers that will ensure the integrity of the resulting financial information created from the journals (provided that the information recorded in the journals is correct). 日記からの情報は総勘定元帳で使用され、日記に記録された情報が正しい場合、総勘定元帳が日記から作成された結果の財務情報の整合性を確保します。 For very frequent transactions, such as Sales, a special purpose “Sales journal” is usually kept, and the totals are posted to the general ledger on a periodic (e.g., daily) basis. 売上などの非常に頻繁な取引の場合、通常、特別な目的の「売上日記」が保持され、合計は定期的（たとえば、毎日）に総勘定元帳に転記されます。 A real account in a business is a record of the amount of asset, liability, or owners’ equity at a precise moment in time. 企業の実在勘定(real account)は、特定の時点での資産、負債、または所有者の資本の金額の記録です。 Nominal accounts summarize a business’s revenue and expenses over a period of time, such as a year. 名目勘定(nominal accounts)は、1年間などの期間にわたる企業の収益と費用を要約します。 The recordkeeping process for bookkeepers is fundamentally the same: Adopt a chart of accounts, make original entries using debits and credits to keep the books in balance, make adjusting entries to get profit for the period right, and close the books at the end of the year. 簿記係の記録プロセスは基本的に同じです。勘定科目表を採用し、借方と貸方を使用して元帳をバランスさせ、調整仕訳を行って期間の利益を正確にし、年末に帳簿を締めます。 Businesses keep two types of accounts: 企業は2種類の勘定科目を保持します。</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Real accounts are those reported in the balance sheet, which is the summary of the assets, liabilities, and owners’ equities of a business. 実在勘定は、貸借対照表に報告されるものであり、企業の資産、負債、および所有者の資本の要約です。 The label ‘real’ refers to the continuous, permanent nature of this type of account. 「実在」というラベルは、このタイプの勘定科目の連続的で永続的な性質を指します。 Real accounts are active from the first day of business to the last day. 実在勘定は、事業の最初の日から最後の日まで活動しています。 (A real account could have a temporary zero balance, in which case it is not reported in the balance sheet.) Real accounts contain the balances of assets, liabilities, and owners’ equities at a specific point in time, such as at the close of business on the last day of the year. （実在勘定は一時的にゼロ残高になる場合がありますが、その場合は貸借対照表に報告されません。）実在勘定には、特定の時点（たとえば、年の最終日の営業終了時）の資産、負債、および所有者の資本の残高が含まれます。 The balance in a real account is the net amount after subtracting decreases from increases in the account. 実在勘定の残高は、勘定の増加から減少を差し引いた後の純額です。</p></li>
<li><p>Nominal (revenue and expense) accounts are closed at the end of the year. 名目（収益および費用）勘定は、年末に締められます。 After these accounts have done their jobs accumulating amounts of sales and expenses for the year, their balances are closed. これらの勘定科目は、年間の売上高と費用の金額を蓄積するために役立ちます。 Their balances are reset to zero to start the new year. 新しい年を開始するために、残高はゼロにリセットされます。 Nominal accounts are emptied out to make way for accumulating sales revenue and expenses during the following year. 名目勘定は、翌年に売上高と費用を蓄積するためのスペースを確保するために空になります。</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The “Trial Balance” lists all the ledger account balances. The list is split into two columns, with debit balances placed in the left-hand column and credit balances placed in the right-hand column. Another column will contain the name of the ledger account—these accounts are determined for the firm in the “Chart of Accounts.” The total of the debit column must equal the total of the credit column, which is why this is called a “Balance.” When the total revenues equal total expenses, the accounting equation must be true: assets = liabilities + equity: i.e., the equality of the “nominal” accounts implies the equality of the “real” accounts. The system of recording debits and credits is designed to keep the “nominal” and “real” accounts synchronized. The modern term for “Capital” is “Owners Equity” and consists of equity shares plus retained earnings of the firm, less dividends paid out. The change in Capital from period to period is “Income” or “Loss,” and the portions of the Capital that this represents are called Retained Earnings (the rest from equity shares). For the accounts to remain in balance, a change in one account must be matched with a change in another account. These changes are made in debit and credit recording system applied to the chart of accounts. Each transaction recorded in a Journal Entry has a debit and credit side, and these sides have the following effect depending on the particular classi.cation of an account in the chart of accounts. Though the need for such “error checking” systems has since been obsoleted by computers, it is still part of the tradition of accounting, and we can expect it to be for some time to come. Each of these constructs: debits, credits, journals, ledgers, and so forth are reected in the processes and file systems of modern computing systems.</p>

<p>Code chunks in many places in Audit Analytics text contain references to external .CSV formatted files. These files are hosted on GitHub in the westland/auditanalytics repository. A conscious decision was made, in writing the code in this book, to keep files in a .CSV format. Many sources of data that accountants encounter in practice retain data in Excel or other spreadsheet formats. Where they are not, as with database tables, they may be reformatted and presented to auditors as spreadsheets. In this vein, the last chapter creates simulated “test decks” of accounting transactions in .CSV formats because such formats are in their own way, the “native” formats for accounting and financial data. Presentation of Audit Analytics data in .CSV formats allows me to show examples of loading/parsing the kind of raw data encountered in practice. This is not how files are typically stored and formatted in R. Nonetheless, for pedagogical purposes, I have cho.sentoretain .CSV formatting for the files that are downloaded from the book’s repositories. Otherwise GitHub’s westland/auditanalytics repository for this book follows the repository standards adopted by R and RStudio, and eventually I intend to release these as CRAN repositories. Raw (.CSV) data files used in the Audit Analytics text are made available to the R workspace by installing the westland/auditanalytics package from GitHub, and using system.file() to refer to specific files. The path to the file is returned by system.file() which can then simply be inserted into any other commands that need this path. The following code chunk provides a simple example.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="r-packages-required-for-this-book">R Packages Required for This Book</h2>
<p>The code in the chapters in this book requires R packages that are speci.ed in the library(“package_name”) commands. These will be packages such as tidyverse, ggplot2, lubridate, and keras. Keras is the API for the Tensor.ow machine learning language and requires a separate keras installation with install_keras; general notes on Tensor.ow installation are provided below. Tensor.ow itself is a collection of algorithms written in multiple languages inside a Python wrapper. It requires a Python environment be installed; further information can be found at https://www. tensor.ow.org/. Package Installation There are two steps to using a package. First it must be installed, i.e., copied to a location on your computer where R can access it. Then it must be loaded into the working memory of R. To install, for example, the tidyverse package, type install.packages(“tidyverse”) and then press the Enter/Return key. To load the previously installed package, type library(tidyverse). After these commands, the tidyverse package will now be available for use by your program code. Tensor.ow Installation Tensor.ow is a machine learning package used in this book; commands to Tensor.ow are called using the Keras API. Prior to using the tensor.ow R package, you need to install a version of TensorFlow on your system using the R install_tensorflow() function, which provides an easy-to-use wrapper for the various steps required to install TensorFlow. You can also choose to install TensorFlow manually (as described at https://www.tensor.ow.org/install/). TensorFlow for R is tested and supported on the following 64-bit systems:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Ubuntu 16.04 or later</li>
<li>Windows 7 or later</li>
<li>macOS 10.12.6 (Sierra) or later (no GPU support)</li>
</ol>
<p>First, install the tensor.ow R package from GitHub or the CRAN repository (search to .nd the site), and then use the install_tensorflow() function to install TensorFlow. Note that on Windows you need a working installation of Anaconda. install_tensorflow() is a wrapper around reticulate::py_install.</p>
<p>You can confirm that the installation succeeded with:</p>
<p>This will provide you with a default installation of TensorFlow suitable for use with the tensor.ow R package. There is much more to Tensor.ow, and interested readers should review the materials at https://tensor.owfirstudio.com/ and at https:// www.tensor.ow.org/.</p>
<p><strong>A caveat on code ’copy &amp; paste’</strong> Though code from this book is available in the package repositories, readers may be tempted in some situations to ’copy and paste’ code directly from the book. Unfortunately, many built-in machine editors try to convert quotation marks to distinct opening and closing forms, which will cause the resulting code to throw an error. Be aware that ’copy &amp; paste’ code may require some additional editing.</p>
